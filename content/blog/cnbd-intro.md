## Introduction

On January 5, 2026, I officially begin my role as an Assistant Professor and the Principal Investigator of the Computational Neuroimaging of Brain Disorders (CNBD) Laboratory in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Florida International University. I created this website to serve as the main hub for communicating our science, sharing lab news, highlighting achievements, and supporting the professional development and visibility of our lab members.

This blog will feature updates about ongoing research, publications, conference presentations, opportunities to join the lab, and reflections on the broader field of neuroimaging and brain health.


## About the CNBD Lab

The CNBD Lab is dedicated to understanding brain disorders through advanced computational neuroimaging. We combine neuroimaging, data science, and engineering approaches to better characterize brain function, identify meaningful biomarkers, and ultimately improve diagnosis and treatment pathways.

### Lab Location

The CNBD Lab is part of the Department of Biomedical Engineering in the College of Engineering and Computing at Florida International University in Miami, FL. FIU provides a dynamic, diverse, and collaborative environment with strong connections to clinical partners and interdisciplinary research communities.

### Research Focus

Our work centers on developing and applying computational methods to study structural and functional properties of the brain in both healthy and clinical populations. We are interested in:

- Understanding neural mechanisms underlying psychiatric and neurological disorders  
- Developing advanced imaging and analysis pipelines  
- Integrating multimodal neuroimaging and computational modeling  
- Translating neuroimaging insights toward clinical relevance  

Through collaboration, innovation, and rigorous science, our goal is to contribute meaningful knowledge to the field and to train the next generation of scholars working at the intersection of engineering and neuroscience.


### Open PhD Positions

The CNBD Lab is actively recruiting motivated PhD students to join us in **Fall 2026** through the BME PhD program (<a href="/jobs/phd-students/">Link</a>). Students with backgrounds in biomedical engineering, neuroscience, electrical engineering, computer science, physics, psychology, or related fields are encouraged to apply. Applicants should have strong interest in neuroimaging, computation, and brain disorders research.

- Priority application deadline for FIU internal fellowships : December 31, 2025
- Final application deadline : February 15, 2026. 

#### ✉️ How to Apply

✅ Send me an <a href="mailto:kalee@fiu.edu">E-mail</a>
- Include: CV and research statement
